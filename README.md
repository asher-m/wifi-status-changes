# wifi-status-changes
Scripts to check if your connection protocol or AP changes.

## Why
This script was created to monitor what Windows (or your AP) is doing with your computer's network connection.

### But seriously, why?
I was playing Dota at University of New Hampshire and kept (am still, as of today,) experiencing serious lag for 3-4 seconds intermittently.  This lag lag, perhaps predictably, occurs during peak network utilization hours, and I suspect it's because my device is being shuffled around between APs and/or wifi bands.  This monitors that activity and logs it when there are changes.
